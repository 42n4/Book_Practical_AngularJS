### Git - SourceTree

- Git UI (OSx desktop application)
  - windows version doesn't work as well (in there I prefer TortoiseGit and gitk)
- Normal Git workflows of commit, merge and rebase are easier
- Always do a quick code review before commit
- Commit often (as backup of code changes)
   - never have long coding sessions without commits
   - use branches for bigger changes (or experiments)
