## List of issues to add

Added here while offline (or non-distract-mode)

- auto create Book.txt from folder structure
  - idea is to prevent having to maintain the book.txt file
  - one option is to add mini book.txt files to each chapter, which can contain specific logic, like {frontmatter} and {mainmatter}

- Add simple Angular website to host the book content
  - this can be auto generated during the build process (which can be used to fix a couple paths, add menus, add back/forward links, etc...)

- Create pool to ask which Part II chapter to keep
  - Assuming Part I takes a good size and it's more popular

- add test to build engine to check for duplicate file names (which would be a problem when the content is moved into the manifest folder)
